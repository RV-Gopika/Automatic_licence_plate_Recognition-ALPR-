# Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to develop an **Automated License Plate Recognition (ALPR)** system capable of identifying and reading vehicle license plates from images or video feeds. This system can be applied in areas such as traffic monitoring, toll collection, law enforcement, and smart parking systems.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** – Programming language
- **OpenCV** – Image processing and plate detection
- **Tesseract OCR / EasyOCR** – Optical Character Recognition for plate text
- **NumPy** – Numerical computing
- **Matplotlib / Streamlit** – Visualization and optional UI
- **Flask** (optional) – Web deployment (if web app is built)

## Usage

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ALPR-System.git
cd ALPR-System
## Conclusion

This ALPR project combines computer vision and OCR to provide an automated solution for license plate detection and recognition. It lays the foundation for more advanced systems in surveillance, intelligent transport, and urban security. With further improvements like deep learning-based detection, multi-language OCR, and database integration, it can scale for real-world deployment.
